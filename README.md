# CSE158 Assignment 2: Recommending Businesses

With a yelp dataset of businesses, users, and reviews, we will create a recommender system that recommends a business to a specific user. 
We used a multitude of columns as features for the recommender system. We also used multiple text mining techniques to strengthen the final model and recommender system. 

ridge_bpr: Contains the sepearte models and the final tuned recommender system.
text_preds: Contains the multiple text models used to build and compare against the more complex ridge model.
